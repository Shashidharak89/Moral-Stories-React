    title: "The Weight of Soil",
    paragraphs: [
      "There was a very clever and cunning landlord who owned a large portion of land in an entire village. He would slyly lend small amounts of money to those in need who came to him for help. Taking advantage of the fact that many were not well-educated, he kept adding interest to the principal amount. Eventually, the repayment would increase so much that people couldn’t pay it back and ended up surrendering their land to the landlord.",

      "Now, his eyes were on a piece of land owned by an old lady who lived near his house. She was all alone, with no family. She planted her own crops and lived a self-sufficient life. The landlord couldn’t figure out how to deceive her into giving up her land. So, he bribed a government official in the village and forged ownership papers in his name. Together with the official, he visited the old lady and served her a notice to hand over the land to him.",

      "The old lady was shocked to hear this and pleaded, saying she had been living there her entire life. The land had been owned by her ancestors, her loved ones were buried there, and she had inherited it. \"How can someone suddenly claim this land now?\" she asked. She approached the local court, but the landlord had bribed everyone and presented the forged papers. As a result, the court delivered a judgment in the landlord’s favor.",

      "Heartbroken, the old lady began preparing to vacate the land while the landlord and his associates stood watching, waiting for her to leave. With tears in her eyes, she approached the landlord and said, \"Sir, you have taken everything from me today. My entire life was spent here, but now I must leave. This is the land where I played, grew up with my family, and this soil is very dear to me.\"",

      "She added, \"We all are made of soil, and so it’s natural to feel an attachment to it. Please allow me to take a basket filled with this soil with me. With that by my side, I’ll always have the scent of this place until I die peacefully.\"",

      "The landlord smirked. Since he had already taken her entire land without paying a rupee, he thought he might as well let her take a basket of soil so she would leave quietly. He said, \"Fine. You can fill your basket.\"",

      "The old lady began filling her basket with soil. She overfilled it and struggled to lift it over her head. She then said to the landlord, \"Sir, will you please help me lift this basket onto my head?\"",

      "The landlord stepped forward to assist and said, \"Oh, you poor old lady! Didn’t you think before overfilling this basket? You can’t even carry this soil—how will you take it with you?\"",

      "With tears in her eyes, the old lady replied, \"Sir, this entire land was mine. I spent my whole life here. Yet, while I’m still alive, I cannot carry even a single basket of soil with me. I won’t be able to take it with me when I die either. You, sir, have taken so much land from others—how will you carry all of it with you?\"",

      "The landlord stood stunned. He realized his mistake and fell at the old lady’s feet, begging for forgiveness. He asked her to continue living there happily and returned her land."

      "Do not cheat, and don’t be greedy. Do not take more than you need. Be content with what you have—sometimes, it is enough for a happy life.",

    title: "The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf",
    paragraphs: [
      "A Shepherd Boy tended his master’s Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd’s pipe.",

      "One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, \"Wolf! Wolf!\"",

      "As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.",

      "Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.",

      "In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting \"Wolf! Wolf!\" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. \"He cannot fool us again,\" they said.",

      "The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy’s sheep and then slipped away into the forest."

    title:"To Respond or React",
    paragraphs:[
      "At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and sat on a lady. She started screaming out of fear. With a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach. Her reaction was contagious as everyone in her group also got panicky. The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but it landed on another lady in the group.",
      "Now it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama. The waiter rushed forward to their rescue. In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter. The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt. When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.",
      "Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering if the cockroach was responsible for their histrionic behavior? If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed? He handled it near to perfection without any chaos.",
      "It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies."
    ],
    moral:"I should not react in life. I should always respond. The women reacted, whereas the waiter responded. Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of, just and right to save a situation from going out of hand, to avoid cracks in a relationship, to avoid making decisions in anger, anxiety, stress or hurry.",

    title:"The Pig and The Sheep",
    paragraphs:[
      "One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where his Sheep were pastured. He very quickly captured the porker, which squealed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher’s in the marketplace.",
      "The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig’s behavior and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate.",
      "What makes you squeal like that?” asked one of the Sheep. “The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do.",
      "“That is all very well,” replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. “When he catches you he is only after your wool. But he wants my bacon! gree-ee-ee!”"

    paragraphs:[
      "Once upon a time, there was a king who had gone to visit neighboring kingdoms. He was gifted a pair of baby Macaw Parrots by the king of the last kingdom where he was visiting. They were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. So, upon returning to his kingdom, he called for a bird trainer and asked him to train macaw parrots.",
      "The king also arranged a place in the palace garden for the parrots. He often looked at them from his palace window. As time passed, one day the trainer came to the palace and informed the king that though one of the parrots was flying majestically high in the sky, the other one was not moving from its branch since the day it had arrived.",
      "Upon hearing this, the king summoned trainer and healers from the nearby kingdoms. They all tried their best, but couldn’t make the parrot fly! He even asked his courtiers to try to find a way to make the parrot fly but they all failed. The parrot was not moving from his branch at all. Finally, after trying everything, the king thought that maybe he needs someone who may be more familiar with natural habitat. He asked his courtier to get a farmer from the countryside and take him to the parrot to see if he can understand the problem with the parrot.",
      "The next morning, the king was thrilled to see the parrot flying high above the palace gardens. He asked his servant to call that farmer to meet him. The servant quickly went and located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. The king asked him, “How did you make the parrot fly?”",
      "With his hands folded with respect, the farmer said to the king, “It was very easy, your majesty. I simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting.”"

    moral:"We are all gifted with energy to find a success in our life, but fail to gather a courage which is required to reach heights of success and end up clinging to the things that are familiar to us. We need to free ourselves from our comfort zone to explore new opportunities and find a success beyond our capacity.",
