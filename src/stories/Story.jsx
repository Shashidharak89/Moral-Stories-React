      <h2>The Tortoise and the Hare</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, there was a speedy hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him, the tortoise challenged him to a race. The hare laughed and accepted. On the day of the race, the hare sprinted ahead and, confident of his victory, took a nap midway. The tortoise, slow but steady, kept moving and eventually passed the sleeping hare to win the race. The moral of the story: Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
